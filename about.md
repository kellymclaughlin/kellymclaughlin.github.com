# About Me

My name is Kelly McLaughlin. I am a software engineer with [Basho Technologies](http://www.basho.com). I work on Riak, an awesome distributed data storage system. My primary interests are creating fault-tolerant, distributed systems with [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) and solving interesting and challenging problems. I live with my wife and daughter in Broomfield, Colorado.
