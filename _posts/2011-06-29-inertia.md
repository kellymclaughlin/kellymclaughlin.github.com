# Inertia

This is my third or fourth attempt at starting a blog. My past attempts have failed for a variety of reasons. My excuses range from being too busy or distracted to becoming too focused on tinkering with the blog engine to having all my time and energy consumed by a new baby. I am still very busy and there are a lot of other things vying for my attention, but I think this time will be different. My daughter is over eight months old now so I am getting more sleep and with the help of [github pages](http://http://pages.github.com) and [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) I feel like this time I have enough inertia to succeed. I like the convenience of composing posts using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and now that I have the setup done and the layout finished, composing new posts should be extremely efficient. I have a backlog of things to write about and there are a lot of exciting things going on at [Basho](http://www.basho.com) and with my continuing adventures with software that are bound to generate even more ideas. Until next time.
